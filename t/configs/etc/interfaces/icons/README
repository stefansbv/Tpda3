The icons are from the Tk::ToolBar module.

Quote from Tk-ToolBar-0.10 POD:

"As far as I know, all the bundled images are in the free domain. If
that is not the case, then please let me know."

"Also thanks to the various artists of the KDE team for creating those
great icons, and to Adrian Davis for packaging them in a Tk-friendly
format."

Extracted from the original tkIcons file to individual gif files.
